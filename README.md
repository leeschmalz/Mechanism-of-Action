# Mechanism of action competition

Mechanism of action kaggle competition. Goal is to classify the mechanism of action for >23,000 compounds into any of 206 mechanism of action classifications. Compounds are applied to pooled samples of different cell types, gene expression data (>700 genes) and cell viability data (100 cell lines) given for each compound. Dosage and duration of treatment data also given. Ultimately, an accurate model could unveil new use cases for common drugs that had previously not been considered.
